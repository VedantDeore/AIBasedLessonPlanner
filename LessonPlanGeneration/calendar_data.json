
now using the above data make a lesson plan using the syllabus such that adding to it a gemini chatbot api call (if it works then using the given syllabus topics make a lesson plan) also if the api is not called then it will make its logic for topic distribution 

below is a sample syllabus :
SECTION-I Types of Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement. Concept Learning: Concept Learning, General-to-Specific Ordering: Task, search, Find S algorithm, Version space and the candidate elimination algorithm, inductive bias, Bias, Variance, Underfitting, Overfitting. Decision Tree Learning: Representation, Basic decision tree learning algorithm, Issues in decision tree learning, and Random Forest Model. Validation: Cross validation, Confusion matrix. Bayesian Learning: Probability, Bayesian Learning: Bayes theorem,Naive Bayes algorithm, Maximum likelihood hypothesis. Ensemble Learning: Bagging and boosting. SVM: Kernel functions, Linear SVM, Nonlinear SVM, Hyper parameter tuning, Handling Imbalanced Data set. KNN Model. SECTION-II Clustering Algorithms- Unsupervised learning, clustering.

Introduction to Hidden Markov model, Genetic algorithm. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: PCA, SVD etc. Reinforcement learning: Exploration, Exploitation, Rewards, Penalties, Markov Decision Process, Q- Learning and Bellman Equation. Artificial Neural Networks: Basics of ANN, Feed Forward Neural Networks, Deep neural networks etc.



most importantly  make a plan such that  such that it includes the start of the semester and end of the semester and in that dates it counts the lecture times and removes the mid semester and class test 1 and 2 and remedial teaching and then makes a plan such that it will cover the start and end of semesters
